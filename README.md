This repository contains demonstrations code on how to use some of the
features of XTC. The repository will be updated over the course of the
semester.

See [this page](http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/) for information about
XTC. If you use this repository as a template, you will not have to
build XTC yourself.
